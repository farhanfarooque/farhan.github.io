About.
My personal website is a dynamic digital canvas that is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

It serves as a reflection of my creative spirit and technical prowess.
The HTML forms its sturdy foundation, structuring the content logically and ensuring seamless navigation. CSS lends an artistic touch, with carefully chosen colors, typography, and responsive design that adapts gracefully to various devices.
JavaScript injects interactivity, enhancing user experience with dynamic elements, smooth animations, and interactive features.
